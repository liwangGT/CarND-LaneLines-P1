1. use continuity of lane lines from frame to frame (start continuity check from high confidence figures)

2. k-Means clustering for Hough lines

3. Vanishing point detection using Gaussian probability model

Kalman/Gabor/RANSAC filtering of sampled data
KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) feature tracker for vehicle tracking
Better lane tracking(probability methods), stability & accuracy
